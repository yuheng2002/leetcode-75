LeetCode 2130: Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List â€” length count + in-place reverse
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/

-------------------Approach following intuition--------------------
Plan:
1) First pass: count nodes to get n.
2) Walk n//2 steps to reach the start of the second half.
3) Reverse the second half in place.
4) Walk from the original head and the reversed second half in lockstep; track max pair sum.

Notes & pitfalls:
- After the reverse loop, the cursor is None; the new head of the reversed half is `prev`,
  so reset `second_head = prev` before pairing.
- Problem guarantees even length; both halves advance together and finish at the same time.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

--------------------Same General Approach + Cleaned Up Version--------------------
Why this version:
- This is a tightened version of the length-count approach. It uses the 2095
  "Delete the Middle Node" pattern (fast/slow pointers) to reach the midpoint
  in a single traversal, so we avoid an extra full pass and reduce constant factors.
- Fewer branches/variables while keeping O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

Core steps (high-level only):
1) Use fast/slow so that `slow` lands at the first node of the second half (even length).
2) Reverse the second half in place starting at `slow`.
3) Walk the first half and the reversed second half in lockstep; track the max twin sum.

Characteristics / pitfalls:
- After reversing, the head of the reversed half is `prev`; reset `second_head = prev`
  before pairing.
- Start the reverse at `slow` (not at `head`) to avoid misalignment.
- Even length guarantee means both pointers finish at the same time.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space; usually faster in practice thanks to one less full pass.
